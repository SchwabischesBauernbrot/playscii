PLAYSCII
an ASCII art tool

Playscii (pronounced play-skee) is the successor to EDSCII. Once it's usable in any way this readme will be updated with instructions for running.

A brief roadmap:

1. Feature parity with EDSCII, with an updated user interface and OpenGL-accelerated rendering.
2. Transparent layers
3. Animation
4. Play mode, in which game objects are represented by animating ASCII "sprites"

Lots to do yet!
