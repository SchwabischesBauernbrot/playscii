TODO

- layers and frames!  8x8 grid of 3 layers
-- blank w/ "hello!" in different spots on each layer
- make this animate w/ 4 frames
-- frames color cycle
-- bind < and > to back/forward frame
- write this to a file with json.dump(string(?))
- read this from a file with json.load(file)

second design approach

art stores no intermediate lists, just arrays of ints for char, fg & bg colors
shader does the rest!
compute char UV in the vert shader
get fg and bg colors from index by sampling from a 1D palette texture
pass in texture dimensions as uniforms (2 bits of data that don't change per object)
art's get and set methods compute index into array and return/set directly
no layer or frame objects!  an Art keeps lists of em, and a few lists for data that used to live in each instance eg frame delay and layer Z.

problem discovered during 2015-01-04~06:

GLSL really can't handle int/uint attributes!  charIndex looks fine in numpy int32 array data but comes into GLSL totally screwy.  works fine when the array and attribute are floats instead.  bug for PyOpenGL devs?

possible test program: two quads side by side, each doing some trivial shader that involves an arbitrary number, only difference being one is driven by an int attribute and the other by a float.
