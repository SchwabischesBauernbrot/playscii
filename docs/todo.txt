TODO

- get cursor working
-- draw all 4 corners of it
-- concept of "currently active layer" that edits go to, cursor constrained to its Z
-- screen-to-3D for mouse pointer
-- only update cursor from mouse loc when mouse moves!
-- [ ] shift active edited layer?
-- draw grid at Z of currently active layer
?? does edit mode always force straight top down and/or ortho view? or can the cursor work in a 3D scene a la an RTS?
--- nah, hopefully this isn't necessary

quake style console:
- understand why setting object properties directly, eg "self.ui.app.camera.tilt_y = 0.5" doesn't work!
- save command: saves current art, or saves current art under given filename

- "export to PNG" feature - how? 1:1 sized offscreen render target? does getting pixels from framebuffer preserve alpha?
-- is color distortion inherent in how good CRT filters work?
-- smart people say: try glReadPixels, make sure framebuffer contains an alpha (it should, pixel format is RGBA)

FIX:

- headbrain2.ed is corrupted, figure out if it can be salvaged with smart parsing - maybe provide a "width override" option?

problem discovered during 2015-01-04~06:
GLSL really can't handle int/uint attributes!  charIndex looks fine in numpy int32 array data but comes into GLSL totally screwy.  works fine when the array and attribute are floats instead.  bug for PyOpenGL devs?
possible test program: two quads side by side, each doing some trivial shader that involves an arbitrary number, only difference being one is driven by an int attribute and the other by a float.
