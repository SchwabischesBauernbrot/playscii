TODO

- support setting FG/BG colors dynamically, include in mutate()

art only changes when user edits
renderable updates from art when user edits or animation frame changes

palette: store colors in openGL ready format
is a texture lookup for the palette (1D or otherwise) even necessary?  table of colors in the renderable's color buffers might be sufficient

is iterating through every tile in an art (layer) to update a renderable going to be bad for perf when lots of renderables are doing it every few frames?
PROBABLY, YES

so: arts generate the openGL arrays (verts, elements, UVs, colors) and keep them around, update them piecemeal and only when edits are made; renderables grab these arrays from their art and resubmit the buffer data as needed

art: (preferred?) charset/palette, size, char/fg/bg data, (later: layers, frames, camera loc/zoom)
