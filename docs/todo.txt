TODO

- start roughing in UI:
-- FPS counter in upper right
-- shift-U: toggle UI drawing
-- command line input - quake-style console?

- get cursor working
-- does edit mode always force straight top down and/or ortho view? or can the cursor work in a 3D scene a la an RTS?

- "export to PNG" feature - how? 1:1 sized offscreen render target? does getting pixels from framebuffer preserve alpha?
-- is color distortion inherent in how good CRT filters work?


---

FIX:

- headbrain2.ed is corrupted, figure out if it can be salvaged with smart parsing - maybe provide a "width override" option?

problem discovered during 2015-01-04~06:
GLSL really can't handle int/uint attributes!  charIndex looks fine in numpy int32 array data but comes into GLSL totally screwy.  works fine when the array and attribute are floats instead.  bug for PyOpenGL devs?
possible test program: two quads side by side, each doing some trivial shader that involves an arbitrary number, only difference being one is driven by an int attribute and the other by a float.
