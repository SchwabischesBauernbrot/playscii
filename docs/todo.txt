TODO

first stage "get app on its feet":
- a single art object (grid of quads)
- random char/fg/bg combinations
- colors cycle per-frame/second

classes:

renderable: geo, character set (get uvs for each quad), palette (feed into shader)
character set: texture, character mapping
palette: source texture, lookup texture

art: (preferred?) charset/palette, size, char/fg/bg data, camera loc/zoom (later: layers, frames)
