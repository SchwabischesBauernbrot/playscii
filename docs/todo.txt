FIX:

- EDSCII files with extra \n (which crash opening in EDSCII) open but are corrupted, figure out how to fix this.  examples: cloud.ed, headbrain2.ed

problem discovered during 2015-01-04~06:
GLSL really can't handle int/uint attributes!  charIndex looks fine in numpy int32 array data but comes into GLSL totally screwy.  works fine when the array and attribute are floats instead.  bug for PyOpenGL devs?
possible test program: two quads side by side, each doing some trivial shader that involves an arbitrary number, only difference being one is driven by an int attribute and the other by a float.
