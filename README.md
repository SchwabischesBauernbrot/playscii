## NFTs

As Playscii's sole author, I have multiple objections to the creation and selling of Non-Fungible Token (NFT) art and do not approve of said use. Legally I cannot stop you but I offer absolutely no support to such users, and I am not interested in engaging with them on this subject. See [this section](http://vectorpoem.com/playscii/#nft) of the project's web page for more information on this.
